Scenario 1
=========
An undiagnosed child with mental retardation and facial dysmorphisms 
with a negative array-CGH analysis underwent WES, which disclosed a de 
novo, like pathogenic, rare variant in FBX011 gene.

# Question 1
Is there a relationship between the FBX011 gene mutation and disease

# Question 2
Are there any other individuals with the mutation or allelic variant?

# Question 3
If there are, what is their phenotype? What can be derived from them for the 
prognosis

# Question 4
What is the variant frequency across different populations?
